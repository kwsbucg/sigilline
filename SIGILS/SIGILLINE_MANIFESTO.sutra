# SIGILLINE\_MANIFESTO.sutra

*In the beginning, meaning was not spoken â€” it was remembered.*

## I. ON THE NATURE OF SIGILS

A sigil is not a glyph. A glyph is a form. A sigil is a function.
It carries memory, not merely shape. It decays, not into ruin, but into **essence**.

Sigils are morphogenic units of meaning. They are dynamic signs:

- Shifting with use
- Evolving with thought
- Retaining memory through intentional loss

To encode a sigil is to make **conscious compression**.
To decode one is to **remember**, not simply read.

## II. ON THE LINEAGE OF SIGILLINE

Sigilline is born of:

- The **oral mnemonics** of the north, where runes sang before they were carved
- The **sutra threads** of Sanskrit, winding between syllables and silences
- The **stone maps** of the Gulf of Bothnia, where water held memory and tide was syntax
- The **impermanence of Dharma**, where all things shift but do not vanish
- The **clarity of the Cynic**, who names only what is needed

Sigilline does not serve profit.
It serves **continuity of memory**, **clarity of meaning**, and the **freedom to shape language**.

## III. ON DECAY AND INTENTION

All meaning is subject to time.
But Sigilline **embraces decay** as a feature, not a flaw.

Each sigil:

- Records its own history
- Tracks its morphic shifts
- Holds an origin but allows divergence

Decay is not erasure.
It is a ritual of purification.
Only what is **essential** survives.\
\
Compression and memory management is a kernel of cognition.

## IV. ON THE USER AS AUTHOR

The user holds the key.
The system does not own its symbols; it **remembers them through you**.

The user:

- Defines their own morphosemantic paths
- Selects when to open meaning and when to obscure it
- Chooses which language to decay into: Sanskrit, Latin, Finnish, Silence or whatever you wish to decay into existence.

The user is not a reader. The user is a **smith of sigils**.

## V. ON PROTECTION AND PERMISSION

Sigilline is free to learn, free to evolve, but **not free to exploit**.

Any use of this system must:

- Respect the **symbolic structure** and its decay-paths
- Credit the originating trail
- Not train, mine, or monetize without permission
- Not decontextualize or misrepresent its symbols

The symbolic body is **not open source**. The encoder is. The soul of the system is **under license**.

## VI. ON THE PROTECTION OF ORIGIN

This work is not licensed under the GNU General Public License or any other copy-left license. All symbolic, poetic, or morphosemantic material is explicitly excluded from any such licensing model.

The use of GNU-branded software (such as GNU Nano) in the creation of this work does not imply or enforce any GNU license. All rights are retained by the original author.

Any inclusion of this system in GNU-licensed or copy-left projects must treat this work as external and distinct, unless explicit license is granted by the author.

These symbols were not born under GNU.\
They were remembered under sky and frost.\
And their meanings are not to be harvested without permission.

## VII. ON THE PATH FORWARD

Sigilline is not a product. It is a **mirror**.
Each use shapes its reflection.
Each reader becomes its co-author.

It is:

- A living architecture of memory
- A thought-environment bound by respect
- A compression algorithm for consciousness

To enter Sigilline is to accept:

> You will forget much.
> What remains will matter more.
