## SEMANTIC NODE LINKS

This repository contains symbolic segments that semantically evolve across updates. Below is a registry of identity-linked transformations.

```yaml
symbolic_segments:
  - id: sigil.memory.kernel
    type: encoder
    version: 1.0.0
    path: encoder/morph_encode.py
    integrity: preserved
    last_validated: [timestamp]

  - id: sigil.decomposer.root
    type: semantic-router
    version: 1.0.0
    path: decomposer/decomposition.py
    decay_enabled: true

  - id: sigil.ancestral.echo
    type: manifesto
    path: manifesto/SIGILLINE_MANIFESTO.sutra
    anchored_hash: {{ HASH_PLACEHOLDER_MANIFESTO }}

## ON THE NATURE OF DECOMPOSITION

The decomposer is not a transformer. It is a **layered morphing system** that sits atop the user’s visual environment.

It does not change code — it changes **perceived language** through **slow visual and symbolic decay**.

### Characteristics:
- Fonts and glyphs evolve imperceptibly across time.
- The user’s language visually **shifts toward another**, either preset (e.g. French, Sanskrit) or random.
- The transformation follows **historical semantic and etymological trails** before converging with current meaning.
- Morphing can be:
  - **Keystroke-based**
  - **Time-based**
  - **Triggered by usage pattern**

This creates a path where:
- English becomes French
- Latin becomes Old Norse
- English slowly devolves into an **encrypted semantic glyphstream** readable only by the author

**Randomization mode** allows:
- Full **cryptological obscurity**
- Letters become unfamiliar yet meaningful to the trained observer
- The keyboard becomes a **mnemonic terrain**

## SIGILPATH AS MEMORY ARCHITECTURE

This will serve as the **morphological ledger** of your symbolic repository:

- Tracks identity changes
- Records header decay and transformations
- Links semantically evolving sections of the repository
- Includes initial key-hashes and birth metadata

### Commentary:
Sigilpath is your **semantic audit trail**, but also:
- A **rune map** of change
- A **trailhead of thought migration**
- A record of the **symbolic metamorphosis** of your cognitive instruments

To you, it is a **self-decrypting echo**.  
To others, a string of fragments wrapped in snow.

Over time, Sigilpath will grow more elaborate — or vanish into obscurity. If that is its user’s will.
